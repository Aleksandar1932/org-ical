# org-ical
Sync org files to a remote calendar.

# Configuration

The behavior is configurable via the config, located at `~/.config/org-ical/config.yaml`. To avoid walking the whole fs, `root_org_dir` is specified in the config and all siblings are crawled.

Currently, there are two sync strategies, i.e. Whitelist and Blacklist.

## Whitelist

When active means that only the org files located in the whitelist array will be synced.

## Blacklist

When active implies that all files are synced except those listed in the blacklist array.
